# research interest

I am passionated in simulating real-world large-scale physical systems with high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. My research topics are: 1) developing high-performance scalable CPU/GPU solvers for simulating large-scale grain/dendrites microstructure evolution; 2) designing physics-embedded neural network architecture for predicting grain-scale microstructures; and 3) optimal control using deep-learning-based reduced-order models

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML #header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
